I recently completed a PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Melbourne, focusing on developing and evaluating statistical methods for handling missing data in complex epidemiological studies with multiple levels of clustering. I am currently working across the University of Melbourne, providing statistical support to a range of projects at the Department of General Practice and the Murdoch Childrenâ€™s Research Institute conducting methodological research.
