I recently completed a Biostatistics PhD (currently under examination) at the University of Melbourne, focusing on developing and evaluating statistical methods for handling missing data in complex epidemiological studies with multiple levels of clustering. I am currently working across the University of Melbourne, providing statistical support to a range of projects related to improving young people’s health outcomes at the Department of General Practice and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute conducting methodological research.
