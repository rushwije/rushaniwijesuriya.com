<p>Ah, <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>. I love teaching R Markdown. But this was not a love at first sight story. When I first started teaching with R at Oregon Health &amp; Science University many moons ago, my students used R Markdown for their homework assignments and in-class labs. This is a great way to start for beginners, to be honest- just use it! I found that most people are not very disoriented by a file that mixes text and code; a concern I had at first and one that I’ve heard voiced by other educators. It seems natural to use if it is your first exposure to <em>all the data science things</em>, especially if you’ve never used an R script.</p>
<p>I did notice, though, that over the course of even just a few weeks, many of my students would reach unbearable levels of R Markdown curiosity. I would see signs of growing pains in their assignments, like how can I turn off these messages and warnings when I load packages? This is so long- how can I make it easier to find things? How can I make it look <em>better</em>?</p>
<p>For all learners, there comes an uncomfortable point where you simply cannot just continue to use this awesome tool without learning how to use it. And I realized when I was teaching that ultimately it was unfair of me to assume that they would just learn an entire ecosystem while I stood idly by, clutching the secrets of being an <a href="https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/1114264529477799937?s=20">“R Markdown Whisperer”</a> close to my chest.</p>
<p>Like, <strong>why can’t you just find the piñata, kid</strong>? But more importantly, what happens when you can’t? I think the risk is that learners either won’t like or won’t appreciate a tool that I genuinely <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/convince-me-to-start-using-r-markdown/1636/7">think would make their working lives better</a>. If I believed it was worth their time to use it, it was worth my time to teach it.</p>
