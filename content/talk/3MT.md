abstract: "The 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) is an exercise in developing academic and research communication skills by reducing complex research down to a brief, interesting and accessible presentation. Competitors are challenged to present a clear and concise, yet engaging presentation of their research project in three minutes, to an intelligent but non-specialist audience. 3MT is a compulsory part of the PhD program for students enrolled through The University of Melbourne Department of Paediatrics. During this Grand Round we will hear 3MTs from students in Heat 2 (of 3) of the 2020 competition. 
This is a great opportunity to hear about the wide variety of research that is ongoing on our campus in a short time. Guaranteed to inform and entertain!"
