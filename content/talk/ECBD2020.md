abstract: Diving headfirst into a PhD after a bachelors can be quite a challenge. Transitioning from a naive undergraduate student to a full-time researcher in a short space of time can throw many curve balls your way, making your PhD experience a truly unique journey. This talk covers my experience of progressing straight from an honours degree to pursuing a PhD, overcoming the twists and the turns, and evolving through it with a lot of lessons learnt.
