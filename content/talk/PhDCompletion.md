abstract: "Three-level data arising from repeated measures on individuals clustered within higher-level units are common in public health studies.  Missing data are prominent in such studies and are often handled via multiple imputation (MI). Validity of results from MI depends on the appropriate tailoring of the imputation model to the substantive analysis. It is unclear how best to achieve this in the context of three-level data. In this PhD, I evaluated extensions of the widely available single- and two-level MI approaches and specialized three-level approaches in various contexts using both simulation and case studies to provide guidance for the practical researcher."
